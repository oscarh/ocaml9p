1. What is OCaml-IXP
OCaml-IXP is an OCaml implementation of the 9P file system protocol, and is
intended to be used as a library.
Currently, only the client part of the protocol is (partly) implemented.
It can be used to implement a 9P client. The implementation is inspired
by libixp (http://www.suckless.org/wiki/libs/libixp) and Ruby-IXP
(http://home.gna.org/rubyixp/).
It was primarily created to be used with Window Manager Improved
(http://www.suckless.org/wiki/wmii).

2. Installation
The usual installation is just a matter of:
make && make install
